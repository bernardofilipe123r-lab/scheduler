## 1. Executive Summary

Toby is a **per-user autonomous AI agent** that takes over the entire content lifecycle — from ideation to publishing to performance analysis — so the user doesn't have to press a single button.

Toby operates as if it were a human social media manager: it creates reels and carousels, publishes them on schedule, tracks how they perform, learns what works, and continuously improves. The user's only job is to set up their brand's Content DNA (niche, tone, topics) and turn Toby on.

### Key Design Principles

| Principle | What It Means |
|---|---|
| **Autonomous but controllable** | Toby runs 24/7 on its own, but the user can pause, reset, or review it at any time |
| **Niche-locked** | Toby never deviates from the user's Content DNA — it experiments within the niche, not outside |
| **Learn by doing** | Toby uses real performance data (not assumptions) to decide what works |
| **Slots never fail** | A 2-day content buffer ensures every scheduled slot has content ready |
| **Reels ≠ Carousels** | Separate analysis, separate strategies, separate learnings — never merged |
| **Database-first** | All Toby state lives in PostgreSQL — survives deploys, crashes, and restarts |
| **Per-user isolation** | Each user has their own Toby instance with independent state and learnings |

---

## 2. What is Toby?

### For Investors & Product Team

Toby transforms our app from a **content tool** (where the user does the work) into a **content engine** (where AI does the work). This is the core differentiator:

- **Without Toby:** User logs in → creates content manually → schedules it → checks performance → adjusts strategy → repeats. Takes 30-60 minutes per day.
- **With Toby:** User turns Toby on → Toby creates, schedules, publishes, analyzes, and improves autonomously. User can review published content from a dashboard. Takes 0 minutes per day.

**Business impact:**
- Users who are too busy to create daily content can still maintain a consistent posting schedule
- Content quality improves over time because Toby optimizes based on real data
- Retention increases because the product delivers value even when the user is away
- Premium feature potential — Toby becomes the reason users upgrade

### For Engineers

Toby is a **background orchestration layer** that ties together existing services (content generation, scheduling, publishing, analytics) into an autonomous loop. It is NOT a new monolith — it's a coordination layer that calls into the services we already have.

**What already exists (and Toby reuses):**
- `ContentGeneratorV2` — DeepSeek-powered content generation (titles, content lines, image prompts)
- `JobProcessor` — Image generation, video creation, carousel composition pipeline
- `DatabaseSchedulerService` — Scheduling and auto-publishing every 60 seconds
- `MetricsCollector` — Per-post Instagram metrics (views, likes, saves, shares, reach)
- `TrendScout` — Hashtag search and competitor discovery via IG Graph API
- `NicheConfig` — Content DNA configuration per user/brand
- `PostPerformance` — Performance scoring and percentile ranking

**What Toby adds:**
- An **orchestrator** that decides when to create, what to create, and how to improve
- A **learning engine** that tracks experiments and allocates more resources to winners
- A **content buffer** that pre-generates 2 days of content to guarantee slots never go empty
- A **personality/angle testing framework** (A/B testing for AI prompts)

## 3. Product Vision

### User Journey

```
Day 0: User sets up Content DNA (niche, tone, topics, examples)
        User creates brands, connects Instagram
        User enables Toby

Day 0 (Toby activates):
        → Toby checks all reel + carousel slots for next 2 days
        → Fills empty slots with generated content
        → Begins discovery scan (own accounts, competitors, hashtags)

Day 1-7 (Bootstrap phase):
        → Toby publishes content on schedule
        → Collects 48h early performance signals
        → Starts building a baseline of what "average" and "great" look like
        → Tests 2-3 different personalities per content type

Day 7-30 (Learning phase):
        → Toby has enough data to compare performance
        → Identifies winning topics, hooks, and personalities
        → Allocates ~70% of slots to proven strategies, ~30% to experiments
        → Adapts to seasonal trends and algorithm changes

Day 30+ (Optimization phase):
        → Toby has a rich performance history per brand
        → Cross-brand intelligence helps cold-start new brands faster
        → Continuously A/B tests new angles while maximizing winning formulas
        → User can see a clear improvement trend in the Toby dashboard
```

### Toby Dashboard (Frontend)

The Toby page in the sidebar shows:

| Section | What It Shows |
|---|---|
| **Status Bar** | Toby ON/OFF toggle, current phase (bootstrap/learning/optimizing), content buffer health |
| **Activity Feed** | Real-time log of what Toby is doing — "Published reel to @brand", "Analyzing 48h metrics for 5 posts", "Discovered 12 trending reels" |
| **Published Content** | Gallery of everything Toby has published, with performance scores |
| **Experiments** | Active A/B tests — which personalities/angles are being tested, preliminary results |
| **Insights** | Top-performing topics, best hooks, winning personalities, improvement trends |
| **Discovery** | What Toby found from competitor/hashtag scanning, what influenced content decisions |
| **Settings** | Buffer size, slot configuration, reset button, spending (future: per-user limits) |

### Key Insight: Toby Doesn't Replace — It Orchestrates

Toby sits **above** the existing service layer and calls into it. This means:

- All existing functionality (manual content creation, manual scheduling) continues to work unchanged
- Toby is an optional layer that can be enabled/disabled without affecting the rest of the system
- Any improvement to the underlying services (better image generation, faster video rendering) automatically benefits Toby

---

## 5. Backend Architecture

### 5.1 New Module: `app/services/toby/`

```
app/services/toby/
├── __init__.py
├── orchestrator.py        # Main loop — the "brain" that coordinates everything
├── content_planner.py     # Decides WHAT to create and WHEN
├── analysis_engine.py     # Evaluates performance, computes scores
├── learning_engine.py     # A/B testing framework, personality optimization
├── discovery_manager.py   # Coordinates TrendScout scanning schedules
├── buffer_manager.py      # Ensures 2-day content buffer stays full
└── state.py               # Toby state machine (OFF → BOOTSTRAP → LEARNING → OPTIMIZING)
```

### 5.2 Orchestrator — The Brain

The orchestrator is a **periodic background task** (via APScheduler, already used in `main.py`) that runs every **5 minutes** and executes whichever action is most needed.

```python
class TobyOrchestrator:
    """
    Main coordination loop. Runs every 5 minutes per user.
    
    Decision priority (highest to lowest):
    1. BUFFER CHECK   — Are all slots for next 2 days filled? If not, generate.
    2. PUBLISH CHECK   — Any due posts? (Handled by existing scheduler, Toby just monitors)
    3. METRICS CHECK   — Any posts older than 48h without metrics? Collect them.
    4. ANALYSIS CHECK   — New metrics available? Re-score and update learnings.
    5. DISCOVERY CHECK  — Time for a discovery scan? Run TrendScout tick.
    6. EXPERIMENT CHECK — Time to start a new A/B test? Plan one.
    """
```

**Why 5 minutes?** 
- Fast enough to react to empty slots or failed content generation
- Slow enough to not waste CPU on a system that mostly needs hourly actions
- Each tick is lightweight — it checks DB state and only acts if needed

### 5.3 Content Planner

The content planner decides **what** to create. It does NOT generate content itself — it produces a **content plan** (a data structure) that gets handed to the existing `ContentGeneratorV2` + `JobProcessor` pipeline.

```python
@dataclass
class ContentPlan:
    """A plan for one piece of content that Toby will create."""
    user_id: str
    brand_id: str
    content_type: str          # "reel" or "post" (carousel)
    variant: str               # "light" or "dark"
    scheduled_time: datetime
    
    # Strategy fields — filled by the learning engine
    personality_id: str        # Which AI personality to use
    topic_bucket: str          # Which topic category
    hook_strategy: str         # Which hook pattern
    angle: str                 # The creative angle/framing
    
    # Optional — if experimenting
    experiment_id: str | None  # Links to an active A/B test
    is_control: bool           # Is this the "safe" variant or the experimental one?
```

**Planning algorithm:**

```
1. Get all brands for this user
2. For each brand:
   a. Get the slot schedule (reel slots + carousel slots per day)
   b. Check which slots in the next 2 days are already filled
   c. For each empty slot:
      - Ask LearningEngine: "What should we try?"
      - LearningEngine returns: personality, topic, hook, angle
      - ~70% of slots use PROVEN strategies (top-performing combos)
      - ~30% of slots use EXPERIMENTAL strategies (new angles/personalities)
      - Create a ContentPlan
3. For each ContentPlan:
   a. Call ContentGeneratorV2 to generate title + content_lines
   b. Call JobProcessor to create images/videos
   c. Schedule via DatabaseSchedulerService
   d. Tag the scheduled item with Toby metadata (experiment_id, personality, etc.)
```

### 5.4 Analysis Engine

The analysis engine evaluates post performance and feeds results back to the learning engine.

**Two-phase scoring:**

| Phase | When | What It Does |
|---|---|---|
| **Early signal** | 48 hours after publish | Fetch metrics, compute preliminary score. Flag outliers (very good or very bad). |
| **Final score** | 7 days after publish | Fetch metrics again, compute final performance score. This is the score used for learning. |

**Scoring formula:**

```python
def compute_toby_score(metrics: dict, brand_stats: dict) -> float:
    """
    Score a post's performance relative to the brand's baseline.
    
    Components:
    1. Raw views score (absolute performance matters — 100k+ is always great)
    2. Relative views score (how this post compares to the brand's average)
    3. Engagement quality (saves + shares weighted heavily)
    4. Follower context (mild normalization — not extreme)
    
    Returns: 0-100 score
    """
    views = metrics["views"]
    brand_avg_views = brand_stats["avg_views"]
    brand_followers = brand_stats["followers"]
    
    # 1. Raw views (30%) — absolute performance
    #    Logarithmic scale: 1k=20, 10k=50, 50k=75, 100k=90, 500k=100
    raw_views_score = min(100, math.log10(max(views, 1)) / math.log10(500_000) * 100)
    
    # 2. Relative views (35%) — THE most important signal
    #    How many X above/below brand average?
    if brand_avg_views > 0:
        relative_ratio = views / brand_avg_views
        #  0.5x avg = 25,  1x avg = 50,  2x avg = 75,  4x+ avg = 100
        relative_score = min(100, relative_ratio * 25)
    else:
        relative_score = 50  # No baseline yet
    
    # 3. Engagement quality (25%) — saves and shares are strongest signals
    saves = metrics.get("saves", 0)
    shares = metrics.get("shares", 0)
    engagement_score = min(100, (saves * 2 + shares * 3) / max(views, 1) * 10000)
    
    # 4. Follower context (10%) — mild normalization
    #    A post getting 40k views on a 5k-follower brand is more impressive
    #    than 40k views on a 100k-follower brand
    if brand_followers > 0:
        views_per_follower = views / brand_followers
        # 0.1x followers = 30,  1x = 60,  5x = 85,  10x+ = 100
        follower_context_score = min(100, views_per_follower * 10)
    else:
        follower_context_score = 50
    
    final = (
        raw_views_score * 0.30 +
        relative_score * 0.35 +
        engagement_score * 0.25 +
        follower_context_score * 0.10
    )
    return round(final, 1)
```

**Key: the most important signal is relative performance within the brand.** If a brand averages 10k views and one post gets 40k, that's a strong winner signal regardless of follower count.

### 5.5 Learning Engine — A/B Testing Framework

The learning engine is Toby's "memory." It tracks what strategies have been tried, how they performed, and decides what to try next.

#### Experiment Dimensions

Toby tracks experiments across these independent dimensions, **separately for reels and carousels:**

| Dimension | Examples | How Toby Tests |
|---|---|---|
| **Personality** | "educational", "provocative", "storytelling", "data-driven", "motivational" | System prompt variations passed to DeepSeek |
| **Topic Bucket** | "superfoods", "sleep", "gut_health", "hormones" (from NicheConfig) | Which topic category to generate about |
| **Hook Strategy** | "question", "myth_buster", "shocking_stat", "personal_story" | Opening line pattern for the reel/carousel |
| **Title Format** | "How X Does Y", "The #1 Mistake...", "Why Doctors Say..." | Title structure template |
| **Visual Style** | "dark_cinematic", "light_clean", "vibrant_bold" | Image generation prompt modifiers |

#### Multi-Armed Bandit (Not Pure A/B)

Traditional A/B testing requires statistical significance (hundreds of samples per variant). Social media content doesn't generate enough volume for that. Instead, Toby uses a **Thompson Sampling (Multi-Armed Bandit)** approach:

```
For each dimension (personality, topic, hook, etc.):
  1. Maintain a performance distribution per option
     (e.g., "educational" personality has mean score 72, std 15)
  2. When choosing what to create next:
     - 70% of the time: pick the option with the highest expected score (EXPLOIT)
     - 30% of the time: pick a random option (EXPLORE)
  3. After each post's final score comes in:
     - Update the distribution for the options used in that post
  
This naturally:
  - Converges on the best strategies over time
  - Never stops exploring (catches seasonal shifts, algorithm changes)
  - Works with small sample sizes (doesn't need statistical significance)
```

#### Separate Worlds: Reels vs. Carousels

**Reels** and **carousels** have completely separate:
- Experiment pools
- Performance baselines  
- Winning strategies
- Scoring parameters

A hook that works for a 7-second reel ("You're destroying your gut with THIS food") may not work for a 4-slide educational carousel. Toby never transfers learnings between these two content types.

### 5.6 Buffer Manager

The buffer manager ensures every slot for the next 2 days has content ready.

```
Buffer Health States:
  🟢 HEALTHY    — All slots for next 48h are filled
  🟡 LOW        — 1-3 slots in next 48h are empty
  🔴 CRITICAL   — 4+ slots empty, or less than 24h of content remaining

When buffer is LOW or CRITICAL:
  1. Content Planner generates plans for empty slots
  2. Plans are processed immediately (not queued)
  3. If DeepSeek API fails → retry with exponential backoff (1min, 5min, 15min)
  4. If all retries fail → use SAFE FALLBACK:
     a. Pick best-performing past content plan (topic + personality that scored highest)
     b. Re-generate with slightly modified prompt ("similar to: {winning_title}")
     c. This guarantees a slot gets filled even during API outages
```

**On first activation (Day 0):**
1. Toby immediately scans all slots for the next 48 hours
2. Fills every empty slot — this may mean generating 12-20 pieces of content at once
3. Uses a throttled queue (max 3 concurrent generations) to avoid API rate limits
4. Shows progress on the Toby dashboard: "Filling buffer: 8/16 slots ready"

### 5.7 Discovery Manager

Wraps the existing `TrendScout` service with a smart scheduling layer.

**Scanning schedule:**

| Scan Type | Frequency | What It Does |
|---|---|---|
| Own accounts | Every 6 hours | Discover our own brand's recent posts and their engagement |
| Competitors (reels) | Every 8 hours | Monitor competitor reel performance, find viral patterns |
| Competitors (carousels) | Every 8 hours | Monitor competitor carousel performance separately |
| Hashtag search (reels) | Every 12 hours | Find trending reel content in the niche |
| Hashtag search (carousels) | Every 12 hours | Find trending carousel content in the niche |
| Bootstrap (cold start) | Every 20 minutes | Aggressive scanning during first 7 days to build data |

The discovery manager feeds trending content into the learning engine, which may use it to inspire new experiments (e.g., "Competitor X got 500k likes on a 'myth buster' reel about sleep — let's test myth_buster hooks for sleep content").

### 5.8 API Routes: `app/api/toby/`

```
app/api/toby/
├── __init__.py
├── routes.py              # Main Toby API endpoints
└── schemas.py             # Pydantic schemas for request/response
```

**Endpoints:**

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/toby/status` | Get Toby's current state (on/off, phase, buffer health, active experiments) |
| `POST` | `/api/toby/enable` | Turn Toby on — starts buffer fill immediately |
| `POST` | `/api/toby/disable` | Turn Toby off — stops content generation, keeps analysis running |
| `POST` | `/api/toby/reset` | Reset all Toby learning data — experiments, scores, personality preferences. Does NOT delete published content or performance history. |
| `GET` | `/api/toby/activity` | Paginated activity log — what Toby has done recently |

## 6. Frontend Architecture

### 6.1 New Sidebar Item

Add a **"Toby"** entry to the sidebar navigation between "Analytics" and "Brands":

```typescript
// In AppLayout.tsx NAV_ITEMS:
{ to: '/toby', icon: Bot, label: 'Toby', end: false },
```

The icon will be `Bot` from `lucide-react` (a robot icon). When Toby is enabled, the icon gets a subtle green pulse animation to indicate it's active.

### 6.5 Sidebar Active Indicator

When Toby is enabled, the sidebar icon shows a **green dot** and a subtle glow:

```tsx
// Toby nav item with active indicator
<NavLink to="/toby" ...>
  <div className="relative shrink-0">
    <Bot className="w-5 h-5" />
    {tobyEnabled && (
      <span className="absolute -top-0.5 -right-0.5 w-2.5 h-2.5 bg-emerald-400 rounded-full border-2 border-stone-900 animate-pulse" />
    )}

);

CREATE INDEX idx_toby_tags_user ON toby_content_tags(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_toby_tags_experiment ON toby_content_tags(experiment_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_toby_tags_schedule ON toby_content_tags(schedule_id);
```

### 7.2 Modifications to Existing Tables

#### `scheduled_reels` — Add Toby flag

```sql
ALTER TABLE scheduled_reels ADD COLUMN created_by VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'user';
-- Values: 'user' (manual), 'toby' (autonomous)
```

This single column lets us distinguish Toby-created content from user-created content everywhere in the UI and analytics.

#### `post_performance` — Already sufficient

The existing `PostPerformance` table already has everything Toby needs:
- `views`, `likes`, `comments`, `saves`, `shares`, `reach`
- `performance_score`, `percentile_rank`
- `topic_bucket`, `keyword_hash`
- `brand`, `content_type`

No schema changes needed — Toby's `analysis_engine` reads directly from this table.

    - Update: sample_count++, recalculate avg_score
    - Update recent_scores (rolling window of last 10)
        │
        ▼
If experiment is active for this dimension:
  - Update experiment results
  - If all options have >= min_samples AND one is significantly better:
    - Mark experiment completed, declare winner
    - Log: "Experiment completed: 'provocative' personality wins (+15% vs baseline)"
        │
        ▼
7d later: Repeat scoring with final metrics
  - toby_content_tags.toby_score updated (phase="7d")
  - This is the authoritative score used for future strategy decisions
```

## 9. Intelligence Engine

### 9.1 Personality System

Toby maintains a pool of AI personalities that modify how DeepSeek generates content. These are **system prompt modifiers**, not separate AI models.

**Default personality pool (reel-specific):**

| ID | Name | System Prompt Modifier |
|---|---|---|
| `edu_calm` | Educational Calm | "You are a calm, knowledgeable health educator. Use clear, evidence-based language. Avoid hype." |
| `provoc` | Provocative | "You challenge common health myths with surprising facts. Use bold, attention-grabbing language." |
| `story` | Storyteller | "Frame every health tip as a mini-story. Use 'Imagine...', 'What if...', personal anecdotes." |
| `data` | Data-Driven | "Lead with specific numbers and statistics. '73% of people...', 'Studies show that...'." |
| `urgent` | Urgency | "Create a sense of urgency around health changes. 'Stop doing this TODAY', 'Your gut is screaming'." |

**Default personality pool (carousel-specific):**

| ID | Name | System Prompt Modifier |
|---|---|---|
| `deep_edu` | Deep Educational | "Create thorough, well-structured educational content with clear slide progression." |
| `myth_bust` | Myth Buster | "Structure each carousel as debunking a common belief, with evidence on each slide." |
| `listicle` | Listicle | "Create numbered lists of tips, foods, habits. Each slide = one item." |
| `compare` | Comparison | "'This vs That' format. Compare foods, habits, routines side-by-side." |
| `protocol` | Protocol/How-To | "Step-by-step guides and daily protocols. Actionable and specific." |

Personalities are stored in `toby_strategy_scores` with `dimension='personality'` and scored like any other strategy.

### 9.2 Seasonal & Algorithmic Adaptation

Toby's 30% exploration ratio ensures it continuously tests new approaches. But it also has specific mechanisms for detecting shifts:

**Baseline drift detection:**
```python
# Every 7 days, recalculate brand baseline
new_avg = avg(last 14 days of scores)
old_avg = avg(previous 14 days of scores)

if new_avg < old_avg * 0.8:
    # Performance dropped 20%+ → algorithm may have changed
    # Increase explore ratio to 50% for next 7 days
    toby_state.explore_ratio = 0.50
    log("Performance drop detected — increasing exploration")
elif new_avg > old_avg * 1.2:
    # Performance improved 20%+ → current strategy is working
    # Decrease explore ratio to 20% to exploit more
    toby_state.explore_ratio = 0.20
    log("Performance surge — exploiting winning strategies")
```

**Seasonal topic rotation:**
- Toby tracks which topics perform well over time
- If a top topic starts declining (3 consecutive posts below baseline), it deprioritizes it
- A previously deprioritized topic can come back if a new experiment shows it's working again

### 9.3 Cross-Brand Intelligence

When a user has multiple brands (all sharing the same niche, per your requirement):

1. **New brand cold-start:** When Toby starts with a new brand that has no performance history, it borrows the best strategies from other brands of the same user. This avoids wasting time re-testing strategies that already won elsewhere.

2. **Cross-brand insights:** The insights dashboard shows which strategies work differently across brands. "Brand A does better with 'story' personality, Brand B with 'data-driven'" — this is expected behavior (different audiences).

3. **Follower-adjusted comparison:** When comparing cross-brand, Toby uses the relative score (vs. brand baseline), not absolute views. A 2x-above-average post is equally impressive whether the brand has 1k or 100k followers.

## 10. Deployment & Resilience

### 10.1 Railway Deployment Safety

**Current situation:** The app runs on Railway with Docker. On every deploy, the container restarts. APScheduler runs in-process.

**Why Toby is safe:**

| Concern | How It's Handled |
|---|---|
| Learning data lost on redeploy | All Toby state is in Supabase PostgreSQL — nothing is in-memory |
| Scheduler state lost | `toby_state.last_*_at` timestamps in DB tell Toby where it left off |
| Content buffer gaps | On startup, Toby immediately runs a buffer check and fills any gaps |
| Duplicate content generation | `schedule_id` uniqueness + slot-based scheduling prevents duplicates |
| In-progress generation interrupted | Same as existing `GenerationJob` recovery (already implemented in `startup_event`) |
| Experiments lost mid-test | Experiments are in `toby_experiments` table — survive any restart |

**Startup sequence (addition to existing `startup_event`):**

```python
# After existing startup tasks...
print("🤖 Initializing Toby agents...")
from app.services.toby.orchestrator import start_toby_scheduler

# This registers the 5-minute tick with APScheduler
# On first tick, it checks all users with Toby enabled
# and runs buffer checks, metrics collection, etc.
start_toby_scheduler(app.state.scheduler)
print("✅ Toby scheduler registered (5-minute ticks)")
```

### 10.2 Error Recovery

```
Error during content generation:
  → Retry 3 times with backoff
  → If still failing: log error, mark slot as "failed", try next slot
  → If all retries exhausted: use safe fallback (re-use winning strategy)
  → Never leave a slot empty — buffer manager will catch it on next tick

Error during metrics collection:
  → Skip this post, try again in 6 hours
  → Not critical — Toby works with whatever data it has

Error during discovery:
  → Skip this scan, try again next cycle
  → Not critical — discovery is supplementary intelligence

Error during scoring/analysis:
  → Log error, skip this batch
  → Will re-attempt on next tick when new metrics arrive
```

## 11. Scalability & Future-Proofing

### 11.1 Multi-User Scaling

**Current:** Single-user, single-process. Toby tick checks one user.  
**Future:** N users, each running their own Toby.

**Scaling strategy:**

1. **Phase 1 (1-10 users):** Single process, iterate over users sequentially. Each Toby tick processes all users. With 5-minute intervals and lightweight DB checks, this handles ~10 users easily.

2. **Phase 2 (10-100 users):** Dedicated background worker process (Celery or similar). Toby ticks become Celery tasks, one per user, distributed across workers. The FastAPI app no longer runs Toby — it just reads state from DB.

3. **Phase 3 (100+ users):** Per-user task queues. Each user's Toby runs on an independent schedule. Priority queues for buffer-critical checks. Horizontal scaling via worker replicas.

### 11.2 Per-User Budget Limits (Future)

The `toby_state` table already has `daily_budget_cents` and `spent_today_cents` columns. When activated:

- Each DeepSeek API call costs ~X cents (tracked)
- Each image generation costs ~Y cents (tracked)
- Before each generation, Toby checks: `spent_today_cents + estimated_cost <= daily_budget_cents`
- If budget exceeded: pause generation until reset (midnight UTC)
- Admin can set/change budget per user via admin panel

### 11.3 New Platform Support

Toby's architecture is platform-agnostic in the intelligence layer. Adding a new platform (TikTok, YouTube Shorts, LinkedIn) requires:

1. A new publisher implementation (like `SocialPublisher.publish_instagram_reel`)
2. A new metrics collector (like `MetricsCollector.fetch_media_metrics`)
3. Registering the platform in Toby's slot schedule

The learning engine, experiments, and buffer manager work identically regardless of platform.

### 11.4 Feature Flags

Toby features should be gated behind feature flags from the start:

```python
TOBY_FEATURES = {
    "content_generation": True,    # Can Toby create content?
    "auto_publish": True,          # Can Toby publish automatically?
    "experiments": True,           # Is A/B testing enabled?
    "discovery": True,             # Is competitor/hashtag scanning enabled?
    "cross_brand_learning": True,  # Can Toby share intelligence across brands?
}
```

This lets us roll out Toby incrementally and disable any subsystem that's misbehaving without turning off the whole agent.

## 12. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)

**Goal:** Toby exists as a data model and can be turned on/off. No autonomous actions yet.

- [ ] Create all new database tables (migrations)
- [ ] Implement `TobyState` model + `toby_state` CRUD
- [ ] Create `/api/toby/status`, `/api/toby/enable`, `/api/toby/disable`, `/api/toby/reset` endpoints
- [ ] Create frontend Toby page with status bar and ON/OFF toggle
- [ ] Add Toby to sidebar navigation (with active indicator)
- [ ] Add `created_by` column to `scheduled_reels`
- [ ] Register Toby scheduler tick in `main.py` startup (initially a no-op)

### Phase 2: Buffer Manager (Week 2-3)

**Goal:** Toby can fill empty slots with content. Slots never fail.

- [ ] Implement `BufferManager` — detect empty slots, calculate what's needed
- [ ] Implement `ContentPlanner` — decide topic/personality for each slot (random initially)
- [ ] Wire planner → `ContentGeneratorV2` → `JobProcessor` → `Scheduler` pipeline
- [ ] Implement content generation throttling (max 3 concurrent)
- [ ] Implement DeepSeek retry + safe fallback
- [ ] Show buffer status on Toby dashboard
- [ ] Activity log for generated content

### Phase 3: Metrics & Analysis (Week 3-4)

**Goal:** Toby collects performance metrics and scores content.

- [ ] Implement `AnalysisEngine` — 48h and 7d scoring with Toby's composite formula
- [ ] Wire metrics collection into Toby tick (leveraging existing `MetricsCollector`)
- [ ] Implement `toby_content_tags` — link strategy metadata to scheduled content
- [ ] Show published content with scores on Toby dashboard
- [ ] Compute brand baselines (rolling 14-day averages)

### Phase 4: Learning Engine (Week 4-6)

**Goal:** Toby learns from performance data and improves strategy selection.

- [ ] Implement `LearningEngine` — Thompson Sampling for strategy selection
- [ ] Implement `toby_strategy_scores` — running aggregates per strategy option
- [ ] Implement personality system (system prompt modifiers for DeepSeek)
- [ ] Implement 70/30 exploit/explore ratio in ContentPlanner
- [ ] Implement experiment tracking (`toby_experiments`)
- [ ] Show experiments dashboard on frontend
- [ ] Show insights (best topics, hooks, personalities) on frontend

### Phase 5: Discovery Integration (Week 6-7)

**Goal:** Toby uses competitor/hashtag intelligence to inspire content.

- [ ] Implement `DiscoveryManager` — scheduling layer on top of TrendScout
- [ ] Feed discovery results into LearningEngine (trending topics → experiment inspiration)
- [ ] Bootstrap mode (aggressive scanning for first 7 days)
- [ ] Show discovery results on Toby dashboard
- [ ] Seasonal/drift detection and adaptive explore ratio

### Phase 6: Polish & Production Hardening (Week 7-8)

**Goal:** Toby is reliable, observable, and production-ready.

- [ ] Comprehensive error handling and retry logic across all Toby services
- [ ] Activity log filtering and pagination
- [ ] Feature flags for each Toby subsystem
- [ ] Admin panel: view all users' Toby states, override settings
- [ ] Rate limit protection (DeepSeek, Meta API, Supabase)
- [ ] Monitoring/alerting for Toby failures (if buffer goes to 0% for any user)
- [ ] Documentation and runbook

## 13. Risk Matrix

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| DeepSeek API outage during buffer fill | High — slots could go empty | Medium | 2-day buffer + safe fallback (re-use winning strategy with modified prompt) |
| AI image generation failure | High — incomplete content | Medium | Retry 3x, then use light-mode variant (no AI background needed) |
| Meta API rate limits during metrics collection | Low — delayed analysis | Medium | Respect rate limits, spread requests over time, skip and retry later |
| Toby generates poor-quality content | Medium — brand reputation | Low | Quality scoring gate already exists in `ContentGeneratorV2`, plus user can review |
| Learning engine converges on local optimum | Medium — content gets stale | Low | 30% exploration ratio always tests new strategies |
| Database growth from logs/experiments | Low — cost increase | High | Auto-cleanup older than 30 days for activity logs, archive old experiments |
| Railway deploy during active generation | Medium — interrupted generation | Medium | Existing job recovery handles this; buffer manager catches gaps on next tick |
| User Content DNA is empty/poorly configured | High — Toby creates off-brand content | Low | Validation check before enabling Toby: NicheConfig must have core fields filled |
